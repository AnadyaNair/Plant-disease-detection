And, you're good to go. You can execute any commands, or scripts and test them.

## 📣 Project Structure

This project is structured as follows,

- [Src folder](https://github.com/janaSunrise/Plant-disease-detection/tree/main/src) contains python scripts for performing operations with the model.
- [Notebooks folder](https://github.com/janaSunrise/Plant-disease-detection/tree/main/notebooks) contains notebooks for training the model with proper explanations.
- [Models folder](https://github.com/janaSunrise/Plant-disease-detection/tree/main/models) contains the trained models and the output categories in a JSON file.

Source folder has 3 scripts, [Training model](https://github.com/janaSunrise/Plant-disease-detection/blob/main/src/train_model.py), [Testing model](https://github.com/janaSunrise/Plant-disease-detection/blob/main/src/test_model.py) and Converting it into [tflite](https://github.com/janaSunrise/Plant-disease-detection/blob/main/src/convert_model_to_tflite.py).
Testing model and Tflite scripts are CLI based scripts for loading, and operating with the
model.
